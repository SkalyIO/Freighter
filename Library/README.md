The JS library is a module that allows you to use the Freighter Library and the FreighterCrypto (for production-ready `AES256-cbc` encryption) and FreighterPolling (real-time data streams) extensions.

# How to install and run

**Note:** The author assumes the use of Linux or Linux-based operating systems. The author is not familliar with Windows.

Text written `like this` are terminal commands.

1. Make sure you have NodeJS, npm and git installed. If not, use the conventional way of your OS to install NodeJS (npm is most often included)

2. Begin by creating an empty directory, open a terminal, and run `npm init` inside the directory. Answer the input prompts (you can leave them to default) to create an empty Node project.

3. Run `git clone git@github.com:peterwilli/Freighter.git` to clone this repo

4. Run `npm install <path ro cloned repo>/Library>` within your project directory you created in step 1.

5. Once you did, you can create a file name index.js where we will add our demo code.
